Field-Work
==========
[Field Work](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openatk.field_work) is an Android app to help farmers with daily management tasks by tracking the status of their fields. The app allows you to add operations (Corn Harvest 2014, Bean Planting 2014) and track the status of each field. It then displays how many acres you have left for the operation. 

Operations, fields, and field statuses can be synced automatically to a free cloud service called [Trello](https://trello.com) using the [OpenATK - Trello](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openatk.trello) App [(source code)](https://github.com/OpenATK/Trello). This allows multiple users to all see and update the operations, fields and statuses simultaneously.
